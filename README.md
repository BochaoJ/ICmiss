Description: Missing data are frequently encountered in high-dimensional data analysis, 
but they are usually difficult to deal with using standard algorithms, such as the EM algorithm and its variants. 
This package provides a general algorithm, the so-called imputation-consistency (IC) algorithm, 
for high-dimensional missing data problems. This package has also extended the applications of the IC algorithm 
to random coefficient models.
